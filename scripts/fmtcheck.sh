# fmtcheck — the formatting gate. REPORTS, NEVER REWRITES.
#
# THE ONE implementation, same shape as scripts/crossvet.sh: every caller
# delegates here so the scope can never drift between them.
#   - .github/workflows/test.yml (the ubuntu leg)
#   - DAG.md's `fmtcheck` task (manual: `bashy dag fmtcheck`)
#
# # Why this fails instead of fixing
#
# The obvious version of this gate runs `gofmt -w` and commits the result. Do
# not write that version. gofmt does not only move whitespace: on doc comments
# it applies godoc's legacy typographic substitution, turning a pair of ASCII
# single-quotes into a curly closing quote.
#
# That is a silent content change, and it has already bitten this tree. A
# comment in bashy's bash53suite cited the exact regression its baseline once
# carried — a trap listing whose argument is an empty string, written with that
# very pair of quotes. Auto-formatting rewrote it into a curly quote, leaving a
# signal-fidelity harness documenting shell syntax that does not exist. Nothing
# would have reported it: the diff looks like formatting, and formatting diffs
# are what reviewers skim.
#
# So the rule is: a human decides. When a file legitimately cannot take gofmt's
# output, the fix is to restructure it (move the literal into an indented
# doc-comment code block, where the characters survive verbatim) — not to accept
# a rewrite of what the code says.
#
# # Scope
#
# Tracked .go files only, so build output and scratch files never fail the gate.
# external/ is excluded: those are vendored upstream forks and theirs to format.
